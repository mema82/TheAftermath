# MVC Comparisons with AngularJS, EmberJS, BackboneJS and ReactJS

### The Goal 

I am just looking to get a feel for the differences between each of the above mentioned frameworks by practicing with a simple TODO project.

### The Reason

JS Frameworks come out so frequently that to become a master may be nearm to impossible, but having a solid understatnding of the basics and capabilities of each framework available to us as developers will help us make the BEST decision when choosing a framework for rapid prototyping.

### The Opinion
Stay tuned for my opinions on this framework.

### The Install Process 

Coming Soon
