# MVC Comparisons with AngularJS, EmberJS, BackboneJS and ReactJS

### The Goal 

I am just looking to get a feel for the differences between each of the above mentioned frameworks by practicing with a simple Todo project.

### The Reason

JS Frameworks come out so frequently that to become a master may be nearm to impossible, but having a solid understatnding of the basics and capabilities of each framework available to us as developers will help us make the BEST decision when choosing a framework for rapid prototyping.


### The Install Process 
Each framework project has a branch with an designated README.

1. Visit Framework branch that you want to view
2. Follow those instruction in the README


### The Aftermath
Stay tuned for my opinions on each and the final results

### The Feedback
Keep in mind that this was made for practicing with frameworks. I'm passionate and eager in my continued education in development and open to any and all feedback. Feel free to contact me by visiting my site:
